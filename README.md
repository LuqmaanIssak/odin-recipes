# odin-recipes

This project is about recipes. I will apply what I have learned so far in this project.

All the skills previously taught have been made use of. Including lists; ordered and unordered. Also making use of links to other pages in different files. More information on how git works has been acquired. I am still working on my skills to write commit messages.
